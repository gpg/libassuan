 * New functions assuan_process_done and assuan_inquire_ext to support
   external event loops.

 * Changed the license of the library code back to LGPLv2.1 to support
   a bunch of GPLv2(only) software which does not allow the use of

   GPLv2(only) software are asked to switch to GPLv3 or to add an
   exception which allow the use of LPGLv3 software.

 * Internal cleanups to make inclusion of the code into libraries
   easier.

 * Made clear that the software is under the LGPL.

 * New function assuan_set_assuan_err_source.  All gpg-error enabled
   software should call this right at startup to switch libassuan into
   the gpg-error style mode.  All error codes are then returned as
   gpg-error style codes (GPG_ERR_ASS_* as well as others).
   If the new macro _ASSUAN_ONLY_GPG_ERRORS is defned all old
   definitions are excluded from assuan.h.

 * Logging of hex strings is now limited to 16 bytes.  To enable
   printing of the full data, a new environment variable
   ASSUAN_FULL_LOGGING may be set to any value.
