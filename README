                              Libassuan
                             ===========

This is the IPC library used by GnuPG 2, GPGME and a few other
packages.  It used to be included with the latter packages but we
decided to make your life not too easy and separated it out to a stand
alone library.

It is currently not intended to be used as a shared library.

See COPYING.LESSER on how to share, modify and distribute the software
itself and COPYING for the documentation.

Please send bug report to the gnupg-devel mailing list or enter them
into the gnupg bug tracker at http://bugs.g10code.com using the
category "libassuan".

The primary FTP site is ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libassuan.
